Ics.py is a pythonic and easy iCalendar (rfc5545) library. It's goals are to read and write ics data in a developper-friendly way.

Ics.py is available for Python2 (>=2.7) *and* Python3 (>=3.3) and is Apache2 Licensed.

iCalendar is complicated, you don't like RFCs but you want/have to use the ics format and you love pythonic APIs?
Ics.py is for you!


Quickstart
----------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install ics



.. code-block:: python

    >>> from ics import Calendar, Event
    >>> c = Calendar()
    >>> e = Event()
    >>> e.name = "My cool event"
    >>> e.begin = '20140101 00:00:00'
    >>> c.events.append(e)
    >>> c.events
    [<Event 'My cool event' begin:2014-01-01 00:00:00 end:2014-01-01 00:00:01>]
