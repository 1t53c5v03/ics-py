Ics.py is mostly made by `C4ptainCrunch <http://github.com/C4ptainCrunch/>`_ with some help from iTitou and Rom1.

A big part of the code was written at `UrLab <http://urlab.be>`_, an awesome hackerspace in `ULB <http://ulb.ac.be>`_ in Brussels, Belgium, while beer was helping us with the `Ballmer effect <http://xkcd.com/323/>`_.

Inspiration and 3-party code
----------------------------
Thanks to :
	- `arrow <http://crsmithdev.com/arrow/>`_ which provides a nice API for dates, times and deltas.
	- `python-dateutil <http://labix.org/python-dateutil>`_ for parsing timezones from VTIMEZONE blocks
	- `requests <http://python-requests.org/>`_ for giving me inspiration from it's beautiful and pythonic API (and it's doc too).
	- `six <http://pythonhosted.org/six/>`_ to make the python3 transition easier
	- `#urlab <irc://freenode.org#urlab>`_ for help and advices.
